# CIK to Ticker Mapping

This Python project loads and maps CIK (Central Index Key) numbers to stock tickers using multiple data sources. The goal is to unify CIK-to-Ticker mappings from various JSON and text files and export the combined results into a single JSON file.

Clone this repository:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cik-to-ticker-mapping.git
cd cik-to-ticker-mapping

```
or you can only download the mapped json file in this repository.
